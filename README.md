This is the notebook I used to follow along with Andrej Karpathy's [building micrograd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ) video. In the future it will contain more notebooks from other AI exercises.

This repo containd mostly working code with (probably) mostly correct notes.
